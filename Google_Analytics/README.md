## 4. Authorization
*NOTE: you probably wonâ€™t have the Admin privileges for Google Analytics, so you will need to reach a person who has them.* <br>

Go to the Admin area and click User Management.

## 4. Code for requesting data fromm Google Analytics and insert into a database with SSIS
The implementation in SSIS to request data from GA is based on a Script Component in C#. The component works as a source, first executing the Authentication using the json file obtained in previous steps, and then sending the request for data.
In the example we request data for Users and Sessions in a specific Date Range.
